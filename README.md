## Project Overview

This repository showcases advanced systems engineering capabilities through three integrated components, each addressing critical aspects of modern distributed systems:

1. **[Secure Code Sandbox](./sandbox/)**: A Rust-based sandbox for executing untrusted Python code in an isolated environment. It leverages Linux namespaces, cgroups, and seccomp to provide process, file, and network isolation, as well as resource limiting.

2. **[Distributed Key-Value Store](./distributed_kv/)**: A lightweight, fault-tolerant, distributed key-value store built in Rust. It uses the Raft consensus algorithm for data replication and consistency, ensuring reliability even when nodes fail.

3. **[Network Forensics CLI](./net_forensics/)**: A command-line tool for capturing and analyzing network traffic. It can parse various protocols and generate visualizations of the network data, providing deep insights into system behavior.

These tools are designed to work together, demonstrating a holistic approach to building and securing complex systems.

## Architecture

The project implements several advanced architectural patterns:

- **Process Isolation**: Using Linux namespaces and bubblewrap for secure execution environments
- **Consensus Algorithms**: Implementing Raft for distributed state management
- **Protocol Buffers & gRPC**: For efficient, type-safe communication
- **Resource Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of CPU and memory usage
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs for system metrics

## xAI Mission Alignment

I am deeply inspired by xAI's mission to "understand the true nature of the universe." This project aligns with that mission by demonstrating the technical foundation needed to build secure, reliable systems that can support advanced AI research and deployment.

The focus on security, reliability, and observability directly supports xAI's need for robust infrastructure to power its ambitious AI research goals.
